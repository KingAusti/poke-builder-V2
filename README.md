We set out to build upon our massively successful PokeBuilder and add user accounts and the ability to save 6 pokemon to your toolbelt.

## User Story
GIVEN a need to search for a Pokemon</br>
WHEN I search for a Pokemon by typing name or number in the search field and press the GENERATE button.</br>
THEN a high-quality, sprite representing a Pokemon and its abilities are dynamically generated.</br>
WHEN I create a user</br>
THEN I can save my Pokemon to a db table</br>
WHEN I press the save button</br>
THEN the last Pokemon generated will be saved to localstorage</br>
WHEN I select the delete button.</br>
THEN the last Pokemon searched is removed from the screen.</br>
